# SoloLearn_CodeCoach

Here I post some of my solutions to past SoloLearn Code Coach problems and the accompanying descriptions. Many problems can be solved in more than one way but these were solved with what first came to my mind or first worked for me. Will be uploaded incrementally over time.

Currently most of them are python solutions because this is the first language I learned and it works very well. Some are in java and other languages I'm in the process of learning so those will be updated soon too.
